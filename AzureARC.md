## What does Azure Arc deliver?
##### Key features of Azure Arc include:

 - Implement consistent inventory, management, governance, and security for your servers across your environment.
 - Configure Azure VM extensions to use Azure management services to monitor, secure, and update your servers. 
 - Manage and govern Kubernetes clusters at scale.
 - Use GitOps to deploy configuration across one or more clusters from Git repositories.
 - Zero-touch compliance and configuration for your Kubernetes clusters using Azure Policy.
 - Run Azure data services on any Kubernetes environment as if it runs in Azure (specifically Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale, with benefits such as upgrades, updates, security, and monitoring). Use elastic scale and apply updates without any application downtime, even without continuous connection to Azure.
 - Create custom locations on top of your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, using them as target locations for deploying Azure services instances. Deploy your Azure service cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Data Services, App Services on Azure Arc(including web, function, and logic apps) and Event Grid on Kubernetes.
 - A unified experience viewing your Azure Arc-enabled resources whether you are using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure REST API.
